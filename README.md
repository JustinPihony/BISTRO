# BISTRO
The Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization is being developed as an an open source collaborative transportation planning decision support system to assist stakeholders in addressing the increasingly complex complex problems arising in transportation systems worldwide. BISTRO uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive strategies fo potential technological disruptions and growth scenarios. 

BISTRO uses the [BEAM](https://beam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (the Behavior, Energy, Autonomy, and Mobility) framework for agent-based simulation to enable the optimization of transportation system interventions based on the emergent behavior of a synthetic population of individual travelers that exhibit sensitivity to cost and time factors of the transportation system.
